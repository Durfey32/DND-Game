## Description
**DND-Game** is an innovative, AI-powered adaptation of the classic *Dungeons and Dragons* tabletop role-playing game. It provides a fully immersive experience where players can engage in a D&D session without the need for a human Dungeon Master (DM). 

The core concept of the game revolves around utilizing cutting-edge artificial intelligence to take over the traditional role of the DM. The AI guides players through a dynamic story, adapting to their choices and actions throughout the game. Players can create customized characters with unique attributes and embark on adventurous quests designed and narrated by the AI.

The game offers a solo gameplay experience, making it ideal for individuals who want to play *Dungeons and Dragons* but may not have access to a DM or other players. By integrating AI, the game delivers a personalized and engaging experience, making every session unique based on the player's decisions.

This project was developed with the goal of allowing players to experience the thrill of a *Dungeons and Dragons* campaign, with features that streamline character creation, narrative progression, and interactive decision-making—all powered by advanced AI.
